//////////////// q1
use of
studentSchema.set('toJSON', {
    virtuals: true,
});
ChatGPT
In the context of Mongoose, the studentSchema.set('toJSON', { virtuals: true }) code is used to configure the serialization of Mongoose models to JSON. By setting this option, you enable the inclusion of virtual properties in the JSON representation of the model.

In Mongoose, virtual properties are properties that you define on the schema but are not persisted in the database. They are computed properties that can be derived from other fields in the schema or perform other custom logic.

When you set virtuals: true in the toJSON configuration, it means that virtual properties will be included when you call the toJSON() method on a Mongoose model instance or use the JSON.stringify() function on the model.

Here's an example to illustrate the usage of studentSchema.set('toJSON', { virtuals: true }):

javascript
Copy code
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const studentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  firstName: String,
  lastName: String
});

// Define a virtual property 'fullName' that combines 'firstName' and 'lastName'
studentSchema.virtual('fullName').get(function() {
  return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
});

studentSchema.set('toJSON', { virtuals: true });

const Student = mongoose.model('Student', studentSchema);

const student = new Student({
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe'
});

console.log(student.toJSON());
// Output: { _id: '...', firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', fullName: 'John Doe' }
In this example, we define a virtual property called fullName that concatenates the firstName and lastName fields. By setting virtuals: true, the toJSON() method will include the fullName property in the resulting JSON object when called on a Student instance.

Note that without setting virtuals: true, the fullName property would not be included in the JSON representation of the model by default.

app.route(path): Creates a route object that can be used to handle multiple HTTP methods for a single path. It provides a cleaner way to define routes for the same path.

res.send(data): Sends a response back to the client with the specified data. It automatically sets the appropriate Content-Type header based on the data type.

res.json(data): Sends a JSON response back to the client. It automatically converts the data to JSON format and sets the Content-Type header as application/json.

res.redirect(url): Redirects the client to the specified URL.

req.params: An object containing the route parameters extracted from the URL.

req.query: An object containing the query parameters extracted from the URL.
